Use Django as the web framework for the SongBook.   Enumerate the steps for this.  
Sure, here are the steps to use Django as the web framework for the SongBook app:

Install Django: Django can be installed using pip, a package installer for Python. You can open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Django:
Copy code
pip install Django
Create a new Django project: Once Django is installed, you can create a new Django project by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
django-admin startproject songbook
This will create a new Django project named "songbook" with a basic file structure.

Create a new Django app: Django is designed to be modular, with each part of a web application handled by a separate app. You can create a new Django app for the SongBook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
python manage.py startapp songbook_app
This will create a new Django app named "songbook_app" within the "songbook" project.

Define your models: In Django, models define the structure of your database tables. You will need to define your models for storing songs, lyrics, chords, and other data. You can do this by creating a new file called models.py within your app directory and defining your models using Django's built-in ORM.

Create your views: Views are the logic behind the templates that make up the web pages in a Django application. You will need to create views for displaying songs, adding new songs, searching for songs, and other functionality. You can create your views by creating a new file called views.py within your app directory and defining your view functions.

Create your templates: Templates are the HTML files that make up the web pages in a Django application. You will need to create templates for displaying songs, adding new songs, searching for songs, and other functionality. You can create your templates by creating a new directory called templates within your app directory and creating HTML files for each view.

Define your URLs: URLs define the routing of web requests to the appropriate view function in a Django application. You will need to create a new file called urls.py within your app directory and define your URL patterns for each view.

Run the server: Once you have defined your models, views, templates, and URLs, you can run the server to test your application. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
This will start the Django development server, which you can access by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000/. You should now be able to use the SongBook app through the web interface.

These are the basic steps for using Django as the web framework for the SongBook app. There are many other features and aspects of Django that you can explore to build a more robust and feature-rich application.

Define the Song, Artist and Album models.  with the following attributes
Song: song-id, title, artist-id, lyrics, rating
Artist: artist-id, artist, type
Album: album-id,  name, description,  list of song-ids 
Sure, here are the model definitions for the Song, Artist, and Album models in Django with the specified attributes:

python
Copy code
from django.db import models

class Song(models.Model):
    song_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    artist = models.ForeignKey('Artist', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    lyrics = models.TextField()
    rating = models.IntegerField()

class Artist(models.Model):
    artist_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    artist = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    type = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Album(models.Model):
    album_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    songs = models.ManyToManyField(Song)
In this model definition, the Song model has a unique song ID, a title, a foreign key to the Artist model, lyrics, and a rating. The Artist model has a unique artist ID, an artist name, and a type. Finally, the Album model has a unique album ID, a name, a description, and a many-to-many relationship with the Song model, which allows an album to have multiple songs and a song to belong to multiple albums.

These model definitions can be added to the models.py file in your Django app, and then migrated to the database using the python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate commands.

Create the views needed for the 3 models.    List object,  Detail object,  Create object,  Read object, Update object, Delete object
Sure, here are the views for each of the three models that provide the necessary functionality for listing objects, displaying object details, creating objects, reading objects, updating objects, and deleting objects:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, redirect
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from .models import Song, Artist, Album

class SongListView(ListView):
    model = Song

class SongDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Song

class SongCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Song
    fields = ['title', 'artist', 'lyrics', 'rating']

class SongUpdateView(UpdateView):
    model = Song
    fields = ['title', 'artist', 'lyrics', 'rating']

class SongDeleteView(DeleteView):
    model = Song
    success_url = reverse_lazy('song-list')


class ArtistListView(ListView):
    model = Artist

class ArtistDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Artist

class ArtistCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Artist
    fields = ['artist', 'type']

class ArtistUpdateView(UpdateView):
    model = Artist
    fields = ['artist', 'type']

class ArtistDeleteView(DeleteView):
    model = Artist
    success_url = reverse_lazy('artist-list')


class AlbumListView(ListView):
    model = Album

class AlbumDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Album

class AlbumCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Album
    fields = ['name', 'description', 'songs']

class AlbumUpdateView(UpdateView):
    model = Album
    fields = ['name', 'description', 'songs']

class AlbumDeleteView(DeleteView):
    model = Album
    success_url = reverse_lazy('album-list')
These views are written using Django's class-based views, which provide a more efficient and structured way to write views. They provide functionality for listing objects (ListView), displaying object details (DetailView), creating objects (CreateView), updating objects (UpdateView), and deleting objects (DeleteView).

To use these views in your SongBook app, you can add them to the views.py file in your Django app, and then map them to URLs using Django's URL routing system.

Provide the directory structure and files for the SongBook App
Sure! Here is an example directory structure and file layout for the SongBook app using Django:

markdown
Copy code
songbook/
├── manage.py
├── songbook/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── songbook_app/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── views.py
    └── templates/
        ├── base.html
        ├── song_list.html
        ├── song_detail.html
        ├── song_form.html
        ├── artist_list.html
        ├── artist_detail.html
        ├── artist_form.html
        ├── album_list.html
        ├── album_detail.html
        └── album_form.html
The songbook/ directory contains the project-level files and settings for the SongBook app. The songbook_app/ directory contains the app-specific files and settings, including the model definitions in models.py and the views in views.py. The templates/ directory contains the HTML templates for each view.

You can create this directory structure using the following commands:

Create a new Django project:
Copy code
django-admin startproject songbook
Create a new Django app within the project:
Copy code
python manage.py startapp songbook_app
Add the model definitions to the models.py file in the songbook_app/ directory.

Add the views to the views.py file in the songbook_app/ directory.

Create the templates/ directory in the songbook_app/ directory and add the HTML templates for each view.

Configure the URL routing in the urls.py file in the songbook_app/ directory.

Run the development server with the python manage.py runserver command to test the SongBook app.

This is just one example of how you can structure your Django app. You can customize this structure to fit your needs and preferences.

Using bootstrap provide necessary css and associated files
Sure, here is an example of how you can add Bootstrap to your Django project and use it to style your SongBook app:

Download the Bootstrap files: You can download the Bootstrap files from the official website at https://getbootstrap.com/. You can download the CSS and JavaScript files, and optionally the source Sass files if you want to customize the Bootstrap styles.

Add the Bootstrap files to your project: You can add the Bootstrap files to your Django project by creating a new directory called static in the songbook_app/ directory, and then creating subdirectories css and js inside it. You can then copy the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files into these directories.

Link to the Bootstrap files in your HTML templates: You can link to the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML templates by adding the following code to the head section of your base HTML template:

html
Copy code
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/bootstrap.min.css' %}">

<!-- Optional theme CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/bootstrap-theme.min.css' %}">

<!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="{% static 'js/bootstrap.min.js' %}"></script>
Use Bootstrap classes in your HTML templates: Once you have linked to the Bootstrap files, you can use Bootstrap classes to style your HTML elements. For example, you can use the container class to create a centered content container, the row class to create a horizontal row of columns, and the col-* classes to define the width of each column.
Here is an example of how you can use Bootstrap classes to style the Song List template:

html
Copy code
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <div class="container">
    <h1>All Songs</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <ul class="list-group">
        {% for song in object_list %}
          <li class="list-group-item"><a href="{% url 'song-detail' song.pk %}">{{ song.title }}</a></li>
        {% empty %}
          <li class="list-group-item">No songs yet.</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <a href="{% url 'song-create' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Add New Song</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endblock %}
In this example, we have used the Bootstrap container class to create a centered content container, the row and col-md-6 classes to create a horizontal row of two columns, and the list-group and list-group-item classes to create a list of songs. We have also used the btn and btn-primary classes to style the Add New Song button.

You can apply similar Bootstrap classes to style the other HTML templates in your SongBook app as well.

What is the process to create the associated tables for each model
To create the associated tables for each model in your Django app, you can use the following steps:

Make sure your Django app is included in the INSTALLED_APPS setting in your settings.py file:
python
Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'songbook_app',
    # ...
]
Create a new migration: Run the following command to create a new migration based on the changes you made to your models:
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
Apply the migration: Run the following command to apply the migration and create the associated tables in the database:
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
These steps will create the necessary tables in your database based on the model definitions in your Django app. If you make changes to your models later, you can repeat these steps to create new migrations and apply them to update the database schema.

Note that in step 2, Django will create a new migration file in the migrations/ directory of your app with a name based on the changes you made to your models. This file contains the SQL commands necessary to create or update the database schema for your app. When you run step 3, Django will apply the changes in the migration file to your database, creating or updating the necessary tables.

Code to  connect database from python 
To connect to a PostgreSQL database from Python, you can use the psycopg2 library, which is a popular Python adapter for the PostgreSQL database. Here is an example of how you can connect to a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2:

python
Copy code
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="your_host",
    database="your_database",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)

# Open a cursor to perform database operations
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute a SQL query
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

# Fetch the query results
rows = cur.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and the connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
In this example, you first import the psycopg2 library, which provides the necessary functions to connect to a PostgreSQL database from Python.

You then use the psycopg2.connect() function to connect to the database. You pass in the database host, name, username, and password as parameters.

After you have connected to the database, you open a cursor using the conn.cursor() method. This cursor is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.

You can then execute a SQL query using the cur.execute() method. In this example, we are selecting all rows from a table called your_table.

After executing the query, you can fetch the results using the cur.fetchall() method. This returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the values for a single row.

Finally, you close the cursor and the connection using the cur.close() and conn.close() methods, respectively.

Provide an updated  directory structure
Sure, here's an updated directory structure for the SongBook app that includes the static/ and media/ directories for serving static files and media files, respectively:

python
Copy code
songbook/
├── manage.py
├── songbook/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── songbook_app/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    ├── urls.py
    ├── views.py
    ├── forms.py
    └── templates/
        ├── base.html
        ├── song_list.html
        ├── song_detail.html
        ├── song_form.html
        ├── artist_list.html
        ├── artist_detail.html
        ├── artist_form.html
        ├── album_list.html
        ├── album_detail.html
        └── album_form.html
    └── static/
        ├── css/
        │   └── bootstrap.min.css
        ├── js/
        │   ├── bootstrap.min.js
        │   └── jquery.min.js
        └── images/
    └── media/
        └── song_lyrics/
In this updated directory structure, we have added the following directories:

static/: This directory contains the static files for the SongBook app, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files. In this example, we have included the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files, as well as the jQuery library.

media/: This directory is used to store user-uploaded media files, such as song lyrics. In this example, we have created a subdirectory called song_lyrics/ to store the lyrics for each song.

Note that you will need to configure your Django project to serve these static files and media files during development and deployment. You can do this by adding the following settings to your settings.py file:

python
Copy code
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'songbook_app/static')]

# Media files (user-uploaded files)
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'songbook_app/media')
These settings define the URL and file paths for serving static files and media files, respectively. The STATICFILES_DIRS and MEDIA_ROOT settings specify the directories where your static files and media files are stored, respectively.

The song lyrics are stored in individual markdown .md file in the media/song_lyrics directory.   The filename will be  based on title of the song after stripping special characters like '{},\'\n\!\?'   It will capitilize the first letter of the word using title() function.  The strip the spaces.  Please provide python code to do this.
Sure, here's some Python code that you can use to generate the filename for the song lyrics markdown file based on the title of the song:

python
Copy code
import os

def generate_lyrics_filename(title):
    # Strip special characters from the title and capitalize the first letter of each word
    filename = title.replace('{', '').replace('}', '').replace('\\', '').replace('\n', '').replace('!', '').replace('?', '').title()

    # Strip spaces from the filename
    filename = ''.join(filename.split())

    # Add the .md extension to the filename
    filename = f"{filename}.md"

    return filename
In this code, we define a function called generate_lyrics_filename() that takes the title of the song as a parameter. The function first strips the special characters from the title using the replace() method, and then capitalizes the first letter of each word in the title using the title() method. It then removes the spaces from the filename using the split() and join() methods, and finally adds the .md extension to the filename.

You can use this function to generate the filename for the markdown file for each song, and then store the lyrics in a file with that filename in the songbook_app/media/song_lyrics/ directory. For example:

python
Copy code
# Get the title of the song from the form data
title = request.POST.get('title')

# Generate the filename for the song lyrics markdown file
filename = generate_lyrics_filename(title)

# Save the song lyrics to a file with the generated filename
with open(os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'song_lyrics', filename), 'w') as f:
    f.write(song_lyrics)
In this example, we assume that the form data contains the title of the song and the lyrics in a variable called song_lyrics. We use the generate_lyrics_filename() function to generate the filename for the song lyrics markdown file based on the title, and then save the lyrics to a file with that filename in the songbook_app/media/song_lyrics/ directory using the open() function.

Add filename column in the song model
Sure, to add a filename column to the Song model in your Django app, you can follow these steps:

Open the models.py file in your songbook_app/ directory.

Add a new field to the Song model for the filename, using the CharField type with a maximum length of 100 characters (adjust this as necessary):

python
Copy code
class Song(models.Model):
    # ...
    filename = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
Run a new migration to update the database schema with the new field:
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Modify your views and forms to update the filename field when a new song is created or updated.
For example, you can modify the SongCreateView and SongUpdateView views in your views.py file to set the filename field based on the title of the song:

python
Copy code
from django.utils.text import slugify

class SongCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Song
    form_class = SongForm
    template_name = 'song_form.html'

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Set the filename based on the title of the song
        self.object = form.save(commit=False)
        self.object.filename = slugify(self.object.title) + '.md'
        self.object.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)

class SongUpdateView(UpdateView):
    model = Song
    form_class = SongForm
    template_name = 'song_form.html'

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Set the filename based on the title of the song
        self.object = form.save(commit=False)
        self.object.filename = slugify(self.object.title) + '.md'
        self.object.save()
        return super().form_valid(form)
In these examples, we use the slugify() function from Django to generate a slug from the title of the song, which removes special characters and replaces spaces with hyphens. We then append the .md extension to the slug and set the filename field of the Song object to this value.

You can also modify the SongForm form in your forms.py file to include the filename field and make it read-only:

python
Copy code
class SongForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['title', 'artist', 'lyrics', 'rating', 'filename']

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['filename'].widget.attrs['readonly'] = True
In this example, we add the filename field to the form and set its widget attribute to readonly so that it cannot be modified by the user.

Python code to read the lyrics filename and store to the lyrics field.
Sure, here's some Python code that you can use to read the lyrics filename for each song and store the lyrics in the lyrics field of the Song object:

python
Copy code
import os

def read_song_lyrics(song):
    # Get the filename for the song lyrics markdown file
    filename = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'song_lyrics', song.filename)

    # Read the contents of the file
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lyrics = f.read()

    # Update the lyrics field of the Song object with the contents of the file
    song.lyrics = lyrics
    song.save()
In this code, we define a function called read_song_lyrics() that takes a Song object as a parameter. The function first gets the filename for the song lyrics markdown file using the os.path.join() function to join the MEDIA_ROOT setting with the song_lyrics subdirectory and the filename field of the Song object.

The function then reads the contents of the file using the open() function and the 'r' mode, and stores the contents in a variable called lyrics.

Finally, the function updates the lyrics field of the Song object with the contents of the file using the save() method.

You can use this function to read the lyrics for each song when you display the song detail page, for example:

python
Copy code
class SongDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Song
    template_name = 'song_detail.html'

    def get_object(self):
        song = super().get_object()
        # Read the song lyrics from the file and store in the lyrics field
        read_song_lyrics(song)
        return song
In this example, we modify the get_object() method of the SongDetailView to call the read_song_lyrics() function to read the lyrics from the file and store them in the lyrics field of the Song object before returning the object. This ensures that the lyrics are always up-to-date when the song detail page is displayed.

Alternatively modify the song html files to  include the filename.md
Sure, if you prefer to display the filename of the song lyrics markdown file on the song detail page instead of reading the lyrics from the file, you can modify the song_detail.html template to display the filename field of the Song object. Here's an example of how you can do this:

html
Copy code
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <div class="container">
    <h1>{{ song.title }}</h1>
    <h2>{{ song.artist }}</h2>
    <h3>{{ song.rating }}</h3>
    <p>Filename: {{ song.filename }}</p>
    <pre>{{ song.lyrics }}</pre>
  </div>
{% endblock %}
In this example, we add a new paragraph element to the song detail page that displays the filename field of the Song object. We use the double curly braces syntax ({{ ... }}) to output the value of the filename field.

Note that if you modify the song_detail.html template in this way, you no longer need to read the song lyrics from the file using the read_song_lyrics() function, since the lyrics are already stored in the lyrics field of the Song object.

Provide the steps to deploy the SongBook app
Sure, here are the general steps to deploy a Django app like SongBook:

Choose a hosting platform: There are many platforms available for hosting Django apps, such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform. Choose one that suits your needs and budget.

Create a server instance: Follow the instructions provided by your hosting platform to create a new server instance. Make sure it meets the minimum requirements for running Django.

Set up a web server: You need to configure a web server like Apache or Nginx to serve your Django app. This is usually done using a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) adapter, which allows your web server to communicate with your Django app. The WSGI adapter used by Django is called mod_wsgi.

Install the required software: Install Python, Django, and any other dependencies required by your app. Make sure to follow best practices for managing dependencies, such as using a virtual environment.

Configure your Django app: Update your Django settings to reflect the production environment. Set DEBUG=False to disable debug mode, and configure your database settings, static files, and media files.

Create a database: You need to create a database and run migrations to set up the database schema. Use the python manage.py migrate command to run migrations.

Collect static files: Collect all your static files into a single directory using the python manage.py collectstatic command.

Set up HTTPS: Install an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS for your app. This is important for security and SEO reasons.

Test your app: Test your app to make sure everything is working correctly. Make sure to test all the features of your app, including user authentication, database access, and file uploads.

Deploy your app: Deploy your app to the server using a tool like Git or FTP. Make sure to follow best practices for deploying Django apps, such as using a separate user account for running the app and keeping backups of your data.

These are the general steps for deploying a Django app like SongBook. The specifics may vary depending on your hosting platform and the configuration of your app.

setup command to build the django project
Sure, here are the setup commands to build the Django project:

Create a new Django project using the following command:

Copy code
django-admin startproject songbook
This will create a new directory named songbook that contains the basic structure of a Django project.

Create a new Django app using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd songbook
python manage.py startapp songbook_app
This will create a new directory named songbook_app that contains the basic structure of a Django app.

Update the INSTALLED_APPS setting in the settings.py file to include your app:

python
Copy code
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'songbook_app', # Add your app name here
]
Configure the database settings in the settings.py file:

python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'SongBookDb',
        'USER': 'larry',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
Replace the database name, username, password, and host with your own values.

provide login screen for the app.  the credentials can be stored in postgres.
Sure, here's an example login screen for the SongBook app that authenticates users using PostgreSQL:

html
Copy code
<!-- templates/login.html -->

{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>Login</h2>
  {% if error %}
    <p class="text-danger">{{ error }}</p>
  {% endif %}
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" name="username" class="form-control" required>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="password">Password:</label>
      <input type="password" id="password" name="password" class="form-control" required>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Login</button>
  </form>
{% endblock %}
This login screen uses Bootstrap for styling and a simple form that takes a username and password input. The form is submitted using the POST method and a CSRF token is included for security.

To authenticate users using PostgreSQL, you can use Django's built-in authentication system and a PostgreSQL database backend. Here's an example settings.py configuration:

python
Copy code
# settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'SongBookDb',
        'USER': 'larry',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'songbook_app.backends.PostgreSQLBackend',
]
This configuration sets up the PostgreSQL database backend and adds a custom authentication backend called PostgreSQLBackend, which we'll implement in the songbook_app.backends module.

Here's an example implementation of the PostgreSQLBackend:

python
Copy code
# songbook_app/backends.py

from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import connection

class PostgreSQLBackend(BaseBackend):
    def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None, **kwargs):
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT id, password FROM auth_user WHERE username = %s", [username])
        row = cursor.fetchone()
        if row is not None:
            user = User(id=row[0], username=username)
            if user.check_password(password):
                return user
        return None

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        try:
            return User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
This backend queries the PostgreSQL database directly to retrieve the user's ID and password hash, and then uses the check_password() method of the User model to verify the password. The get_user() method is required by the authentication system and returns the User model for the given ID.

With these components in place, you should be able to use the login screen to authenticate users using PostgreSQL in the SongBook app.

Create a populate database python script using the lyrics filename.md files as input.   The song title and artist are in {title: <title>} line and  {artist: <artist>} line respectively.
Sure, here's an example Python script that populates the SongBook database using the lyrics filename.md files as input:

python
Copy code
# populate_db.py

import os
import re
from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
from django.db import transaction
from songbook_app.models import Song, Artist, Album

MEDIA_DIR = '/path/to/media/directory'

@transaction.atomic
def populate_database():
    # Iterate over all the song lyrics files in the media directory
    for filename in os.listdir(MEDIA_DIR):
        if filename.endswith('.md'):
            with open(os.path.join(MEDIA_DIR, filename)) as f:
                # Read the file contents and extract the song title and artist
                content = f.read()
                title = re.search(r'{title:\s*(.+)\s*}', content).group(1).title()
                artist_name = re.search(r'{artist:\s*(.+)\s*}', content).group(1).title()
                lyrics = content.split('\n', 2)[-1]

                # Create or retrieve the artist
                try:
                    artist = Artist.objects.get(name=artist_name)
                except ObjectDoesNotExist:
                    artist = Artist.objects.create(name=artist_name)

                # Create or retrieve the album
                album_name = 'Single'
                try:
                    album = Album.objects.get(name=album_name)
                except ObjectDoesNotExist:
                    album = Album.objects.create(name=album_name)

                # Create the song
                song = Song.objects.create(
                    title=title,
                    artist=artist,
                    lyrics=lyrics,
                    album=album,
                    filename=filename,
                )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    populate_database()
This script uses regular expressions to extract the song title and artist from the filename.md files, and then creates or retrieves the corresponding Artist and Album models using Django's object-relational mapping (ORM) system. Finally, it creates a new Song model with the extracted data and saves it to the database using the ORM.

Note that the MEDIA_DIR variable in the script should be replaced with the path to your actual media directory containing the filename.md files.
